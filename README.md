**By Ambala Mouli**

This repository contains completed web development tasks as part of the **Oasis Infobyte Internship Program**. Each task is developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with a focus on clean UI, interactivity, and responsive design.

In this internship I was offered three levels with having 4 tasks respectively. We have to choose only one level. So, I choose to work on the level 2 in which I have to complete the following tasks:

## 🔖 Task List

### ✅ Level 2 - Task 1: Calculator
1.It takes a little skill to create a calculator with basic mathematical functionalities using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
2.Calculators require an interactive interface to perform basic functions such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.
3.It will need a display screen to display the user’s input and give the results.
4.The grid system in CSS is for the alignments of buttons on the calculator.
5.The additional tools you need to build a fully functional calculator include eventListeners, if-else statements, operators, loops, and so on.
6.I also add a dark/light mode which looks good to the website.
